Updated [pshizzle's](https://github.com/pshizzle) CoffeeScript [adaptation](https://github.com/pshizzle/spin.coffee) of Felix Gnass' spin.js (Source: http://fgnass.github.com/spin.js/).

This fork supports spin.js options as of v2.1.2, but preserves the positioning logic of Philip's spin.coffee version.  Updated comments where I could.

##### New options supported:
* scale
* corners
* rotate
* direction
* zIndex
* className
* 'transform3d' renamed to 'hwaccel'

(I also didn't touch the VML section.)
